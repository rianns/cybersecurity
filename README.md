# Cybersecurity Portfolio

### Professional Statement

I am passionate about information security and I enjoy creating solutions that can positively impact an organisation and the people it serves.

My interest in information security stems from a fascination with the ever-evolving world of technology. The constant threats and vulnerabilities that exist in cyberspace drive me to stay informed and up-to-date with the latest security practices.

Information security directly affects all individuals. In an increasingly interconnected world, personal data is constantly being shared and stored online. By creating solutions that protect this data, we can empower individuals to have greater control over their own digital lives and privacies.
